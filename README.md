The National Basketball Association (NBA) salary cap was set at $109.14 million for the 2019-20 season.  The salary cap is the limit to the total amount of money teams are allowed to pay their players.  The purpose of the cap is to control cost and maintain competitive balance between small and large market teams.  In this project we will analyze playerâ€™s salary and average points per games to determine the value of each point as it relate to salary and team budget/salary cap.
